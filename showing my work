rate units is:

(phase proportion * (samples per phase)) / clock tick


Hz units is:

(phase proportion) / second


what's the phase proportion per clock tick?
it is:

(cycles / second) * (seconds in a clock tick).


so,

frequency * (seconds in a clock tick)



frequency * (seconds in a clock tick) =
frequency * (1 / clock frequency) =
frequency / clock frequency.


so the rate is i guess


frequency / clock frequency * samples per phase
